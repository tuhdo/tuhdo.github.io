#+TITLE: Setup Emacs with PDF Tools and Xwidgets web browser on Windows

Installation instructions:

* Prerequisite

- Download =Cywing= setup from [[https://cygwin.com/install.html][Cygwin's Install page]].

- If you want only the PDF reader, you can install the Emacs shipped by Cygwin.
  However, if you also want the web browser, then you need to compile your own
  Emacs 25 from source.

* With PDF reader

[[./static/setup-emacs-windows/pdf_tools_windows_latex.gif][DEMO]] (Notice how I press some text in PDF file and Latex buffer jumps to
corresponding automatically).

First, donâ€™t use MELPA; you must install pdf-tools manually from this
repository. Then, you need to install Cygwin. The following dependencies are
needed:

If you don't plan to use Xwidget browser, just install Emacs from Cygwin:

- emacs-w32 (Editors category)

Then install the tool chain for PDF Tools:

- make (*Devel* category)
- gcc-core (*Devel* category)
- gcc-g++ (*Devel* category)
- autoconf (*Devel* category)
- automake (*Devel* category)
- perl (*Perl* category)

Then install Poppler development library:

- libpoppler-devel (*Lib* category)
- libpoppler-glib-devel (*Lib* category)

Just type the dependency name above and click to choose. For example, enter
libpoppler-devel into the search box.

After all dependencies installed, clone =pdf-tools=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools
#+END_SRC

Then, go into =pdf-tools= directory and build it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make
#+END_SRC

When the compilation is done, from your Cygwin Terminal, copy
the file =server/epdfinfo.exe= into =/usr/bin/=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cp server/epdfinfo.exe /usr/bin/
#+END_SRC

Then, also within *Cygwin*, run *emacs* command. Within Emacs, run the Emacs
command:

- =M-x package-install-file=
- Press =RET=
- Select pdf-tools-${VERSION}.tar RET (the tar file is in your repository).

Finally, run pdf-tools-install and enjoy. Here is the configuration you can put
in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (pdf-tools-install)
  (setq pdf-info-epdfinfo-program "/usr/bin/epdfinfo.exe")
#+END_SRC

* With Xwidgets browser

[[./static/setup-emacs-windows/emacs_xwidgets_windows.png][DEMO]]

Development libraries for building Emacs that supports Xwidgets:

- libgif-devel (*Graphics* category)
- libtiff-devel (*Lib* category)
- libjpeg-devel (*Devel* category)
- libxpm-devel (*Devel* category)
- libgnutls-devel (*Devel* category)
- libpng-devel (*Devel* category)
- libncurses-devel (*Lib* category)
- libgtk3-drivel (*Lib* category)
- libwebkitgtk3.0-devel (*Lib* category)

Then, install X11 server for displaying Emacs:

- xorg-server (*X11* category)
- xinit (*X11* category)

Then, open Cygwin terminal and compile Emacs:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    ./configure --with-xwidgets
    make
    make install
  #+END_SRC

Finally, set your display:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
 echo "export DISPLAY=:0.0" >> .bash_profile
#+END_SRC

Then, from your Start Menu, open the X server:

[[file:static/setup-emacs-windows/xserver_example.png][file:static/setup-emacs-windows/xserver_example.png]]

Then, run your compiled Emacs 25 from Cygwin terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacs
#+END_SRC
