#+TITLE: A Package in a league of its own: =Helm=

_Author_:

- Tamas Patrovic (original author), from 2007. At this time, Helm was
  named =Anything=.
- rubikitch =rubikitch@ruby-lang.org=, from 2008-2011. Helm was still
  named =Anything=
- [[https://github.com/thierryvolpiatto][Thierry Volpiatto]] (current maintainer).
  =thierry.volpiatto@gmail.com=, from 2011-present. =Anything= was
  renamed to =Helm= during this period.
  
_Homepage_: [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][GitHub]]

_Features_:

=Helm= is an incremental completion and selection narrowing framework for
Emacs. It will help steer you in the right direction when you're
looking for stuff in Emacs (like buffers, files, etc).

Helm is a fork of =anything.el= (originally written by Tamas Patrovic) and
can be considered to be its successor. =Helm= sets out to clean up the
legacy code in =anything.el= and provide a cleaner, leaner and more
modular tool, that's not tied in the trap of backward compatibility.

_Installation_:

You can use [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Emacs Prelude]] or [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]], which are already setup properly. You can
skip all configuration code in this guide. But note that by default, [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Emacs
Prelude]] does not enable Helm. Please follow [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude#helm][these instructions]] to enable Helm.
[[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs][Spacemacs]] enables Helm by default.

If you are a Spacemacs user, you don't have to do anything. If you have
your own Emacs configuration, run =M-x list-packages= and select the *helm*
package, then install it. After finish installing, add this
configuration to activate the package:

Minimal config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'helm-config)
  (helm-mode 1)
#+end_src

Extended config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'helm)
  (require 'helm-config)

  ;; The default "C-x c" is quite close to "C-x C-c", which quits Emacs.
  ;; Changed to "C-c h". Note: We must set "C-c h" globally, because we
  ;; cannot change `helm-command-prefix-key' once `helm-config' is loaded.

  (define-key helm-map (kbd "<tab>") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; rebind tab to run persistent action
  (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-i") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; make TAB work in terminal
  (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-z")  'helm-select-action) ; list actions using C-z

After using Helm, you are going to have a big change in the way you
use Emacs. After you get used to the Helm way, you won't want to leave
it. However, if you don't like Helm, you can still use Ido, which is
introduced in a later section. Let's learn how to use helm by playing with
it.

Completion with Helm is very different from the usual Emacs
completion:

- You type something.

- Instead of *TAB* to expand the common part until you find your
  candidates, in Helm, you type parts of the candidate you want to
  search for, separated by spaces. In Helm, these strings are called
  *patterns*. Patterns can also be regexps.

- Helm will try to search and sort according to highest match, from
  top to bottom. The best match is at the top, so you can press *RET*
  and select it.

- You can navigate the buffer with *C-n* and *C-p* or *<up>* and
  *<down>* to move up/down, *C-v* and *M-v* to move to next/previous
  pages, and *M-<* and *M->* to move to the top and bottom of the Helm
  buffer.

- You can mark candidates with *C-SPC*; this is useful when you need
  to perform an action on many candidates of your choice. *M-a* to
  select all.

- You can insert marked candidates into the current buffer with *C-c
  C-i*. This is useful when you have narrowed to a list of candidates,
  i.e. files, and then you want to save such candidates.

- If you find the current horizontal Helm window is small, you can
  always switch it to a vertical window with *C-t*. Running *C-t* again
  returns the Helm window back to horizontal and so on.

You can practice the above commands with *C-x b*, which runs
=helm-mini=. If you mark more than one buffer, *RET* opens the
selected buffers.

*_IMPORTANT_*: /Please remember that, when you use Helm, you never *TAB*/
/to complete prefixes like vanilla or other packages like Ido and its/
/related packages. In Helm, when you type something, candidates get/
/updated *automatically*. In vanilla Emacs, you have to *TAB* to get a/
/list of candidates. This is a great feature from Helm, not a lack of a/
/feature. You have to forget the habit of *TAB*'ing to get/
/candidates. If you want quick completion of search patterns in the Helm/
/prompt, you always have =hippie-expand= to replace the *TAB*/
/behavior, as introduced at the beginning of this section. This is/
/the biggest confusion for new people switching to Helm. When you are/
/used to Helm, you will love it./

When you execute a Helm command, you enter a Helm session. A Helm
session is a dedicated state to working with Helm features; while in a
Helm session, a dedicated Helm buffer is always opened. When you quit
a Helm session, a Helm buffer is closed. In Helm, you basically need
to remember these 3 commands:

- Access the action menu with *TAB*. An action is a command to run on
  marked candidates (one or more) and quits the current Helm session; an
  action menu is a text-based menu that lists actions you can
  take. For example, =Find File= (open file), =Find File in Dired=,
  =Grep File=...

- *C-z* executes *helm-execute-persistent-action*; a persistent action
  is an action that you use in a Helm session that does not quit the
  session.

- In some Helm sessions, such as =helm-find-files= or =helm-mini=, you
  can select more than one candidates and execute actions on them,
  such as =grep= or =open=.

However, for convenience, let's *TAB* with *C-z* in the above
settings, so we can use *TAB* more comfortably, because you actually
use *helm-execute-persistent-action* more than
*helm-select-action* by adding the code snippet below:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (define-key helm-map (kbd "<tab>") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; rebind tab to do persistent action
  (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-i") 'helm-execute-persistent-action) ; make TAB works in terminal
  (define-key helm-map (kbd "C-z")  'helm-select-action) ; list actions using C-z
#+end_src

In a Helm session, if you need help, use *C-c ?*, or refer to this
manual again. The commands in the key bindings above are good enough
to help you use Helm productively.

* Why is Helm powerful?
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       260dfe60-eb43-4d20-b1c4-b51af5133a32
:END:
- /_Simple and Consistent interface_/: Every Helm session starts with
  the same, simple interface: a prompt for entering search patterns and
  a Helm buffer for displying results as the user types. Because of the
  consistent and simple interface, new people use Helm with ease.

- /_Interactivity_/: By nature, Helm is very interactive: as a user
  types, results get updated immediately in the Helm buffer. Because
  of this feature, Helm provides a unique interactive version of many
  commmands that do not exist outside of Helm. For example,
  =helm-ff-run-grep=, which updates grep results as you type.

- /_Focus on finding what you want first, decide what to do with it
  later_/: With Helm, you don't have to think about what you are going to
  do with a candidate until you have found it. For example, needing to
  decide whether you should open a file in the current window or in other
  window *before* opening a file. In contrast, Helm helps you focus on
  what you want to find; once you find your desired object (such as a
  file or directory), you *only then* decide what to do with it, such as
  opening the file in another window or opening the file as root. This
  has the advantage that you don't have to cancel your executing command
  if you decide that the action you are taking is not appropriate
  anymore. For example, if you are executed *C-x C-f* to open a file, but
  have a second thought that opening the file in another window is
  better. Then you press *C-g* to cancel the command and re-execute the
  *C-x 4 C-f* version and have to start your navigating session all over
  again!

- /_Matching mechanism_/: This is a powerful feature in Helm that I
  haven't seen in other packages: out of order matching, *with regular
  expression*. That's right, you can enter every search pattern as a
  regexp!. A really powerful concept: it enhances explanatory power
  for many things. One use cases is exploring a new project: using
  Helm, you can "learn" the project structure interactively. For
  example, suppose I'm completely new to the Linux kernel source tree,
  and I wonder whether a file =main.c= exists for =x86=
  architecture. I know that they must have =x86= directory somewhere,
  and the file could contain =main.c= in it, i.e. It can be =main.c=
  or =x86-main.c=. These are the only pieces of information I know, so I
  tried it in Helm Projectile (a package that makes use of Helm framework,
  which does not come with stock Helm. You can read more about it [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-projectile.html][in my
  Helm Projectile guide]]):

  [[file:static/helm_projectile.gif][file:static/helm_projectile.gif]]

  First, I enter =main.c=, and I got lots of candidates. Then, I only
  want the =main.c= inside the x86 directory, so I type =x86=. The whole
  pattern is =main.c x86= and Helm returns the correct candidate:
  =arch/x86/boot/main.c=.

  It does exist. I also wonder where =i5100_edac.c= exists, because
  Intel has had a datasheet for it available for a long time, so it must be
  implemented. As demonstrated in the above screencast, there was only
  one =i5100_eda.c=. Using the so-called "fuzzy-matching" mechanism,
  you are still required to know things in advance and this severely
  limits the explanatory power. For example, to get to the file
  =driver/edac/i5100_edac.c=, you have to know the path to fuzzy
  match like this: =dedi51=; *d* for matching =driver=, *ed* for matching
  =edac= because other directories also start with "e"; *i51* for
  matching =i5100_edac.c= because several files also start with "i5",
  or contain "1" and "0" or "edac" in it. "i51" is the only unique
  prefix. Using Helm, you can immediately enter the unique pattern of
  a candidate and ignore the common prefix to get a candidate. For
  example, in the screencast above, I got =driver/edac/i5100_edac.c=
  immediately just by typing "*i51*" and the file was narrowed down.

  Fuzzy matching can also be less useful when working with a large source
  tree, where many files share a common prefix.

  Starting from Helm 1.6.5, Helm includes fuzzy matching for many
  commands and a way for a package writer to activate fuzzy matching.

- /Performance/: Helm can work with over 30000 candidates or more with no
  problems.

* Operate on text at point:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8de25a41-da8b-42b5-b152-e62ef75d2bfd
:END:
If you are already in a Helm session, you can still get input from the
current editing buffer by the following key bindings:

- *C-w* yanks word at point, starting from point to the end of the
  word, into the Helm prompt (the minibuffer).
- *M-n* yanks symbol at point

If =helm-mode= is activated, help commands also automatically
recognize symbols at point if such symbols exist in Emacs, and use
the Helm interface for interactive selection. For example:

- *C-h f*, which runs =describe-function=, automatically takes the
  symbol at point as the default for searching function.
- *C-h v*, which runs =describe-variable=, automatically takes the
  symbol at point as the default for searching variable.
- *C-h w*, which runs =where-is=, automatically takes the
  symbol at point as the default for showing the key binding for a
  command.
- ... and so on... (*C-h C-h* to view all commands)

All of those commands automatically make use of Helm.

* Autoresize
Helm can resize its buffer automatically to fit the number of
candidates if you enable =helm-autoresize-mode=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (helm-autoresize-mode t)
#+end_src

You can customize the minimum and maximum height that Helm can resize
with these two variable: 

- =helm-autoresize-max-height=
- =helm-autoresize-min-height=

By default, =helm-autoresize-max-height= is set to 40, meaning the Helm
candidate buffer has a maximum height of 40% of the current frame
height. Similarly, =helm-autoresize-min-height= specifies a minimum
height for the Helm candidate buffer as a percentage of the current frame
height.

If you don't want the Helm window to be resized, you can set
=helm-autoresize-max-height= equal to =helm-autoresize-min-height=.

If you use [[https://github.com/roman/golden-ratio.el][golden-ratio]], you have to disable its interference with the Helm window
(Note: If you are using Spacemacs, you don't have to add this bit of configuration):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun pl/helm-alive-p ()
    (if (boundp 'helm-alive-p)
        (symbol-value 'helm-alive-p)))

  (add-to-list 'golden-ratio-inhibit-functions 'pl/helm-alive-p)
#+end_src

In DEMO 1, =helm-autoresize-max-height= is not equal to
=helm-autoresize-min-height= (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in
minibuffer):

[[file:static/part3/helm-autoresize-mode.gif][file:static/part3/helm-autoresize-mode.gif]]

In DEMO 2, =helm-autoresize-max-height= is equal to
=helm-autoresize-min-height= (begins when ~START DEMO~ appears in
minibuffer):

[[file:static/part3/helm-autoresize-fix.gif][file:static/part3/helm-autoresize-fix.gif]]

* Command: =helm-M-x=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       500a1c68-ab43-40a5-97c3-5d556a9f748d
:END:
_Key binding_:

No default key binding. We should give it one:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'helm-M-x)
#+end_src

_Description_:

=M-x= and see the difference. You will see a buffer that lists
commands in Emacs. Some of you may not like it because it seems
overkill at first. However, even if you really don't like, please bear
with me until the end.

Now, type =li pa=; that's right =li= , a space and =pa=. You will see,
=list-packages= is at the top. Surprise! Let's try another input. Now,
type =pa ^li=, and you will receive =list-package= as the first
entry.

=helm-M-x= is also better then the default =M-x=, because it provides
key bindings right next to the commands, and *TAB* provides you the
built-in documentation of that command in another buffer.

Starting from 1.6.5, =helm-M-x= can fuzzy match candidates, but this is
not enabled by default. To enable fuzzy matching, add the following
setting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq helm-M-x-fuzzy-match t) ;; optional fuzzy matching for helm-M-x
#+end_src


*NOTE*: You have to bind =helm-M-x= to *M-x* manually. Otherwise, you
 still get Helm completion, but using the vanilla *M-x* that does not
 provides the above features like showing key bindings and *TAB* to
 open built-in documentation. Another important thing is, you have to
 pass the prefix argument *AFTER* you run =helm-M-x=, because your prefix
 argument will be displayed in the modeline when in =helm-M-x=
 buffer. Passing prefix argument *BEFORE* =helm-M-x= *has no effect*.

_Demo_:

* Command: =helm-show-kill-ring=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       77b4d145-c280-4ed4-98a7-d645fe1d18bf
:END:
_Key binding_:

No default key binding. We should give it one:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-y") 'helm-show-kill-ring)
#+end_src

_Description_:

Do you remember the binding =C-y= [[http://tuhdo.github.io/emacs-tutor.html#sec-7-15][cycle the kill ring]]? However, working with
default kill ring is painful because you have a burden to remember an
invisible thing, that is the kill ring, at which position you kill
what. To view the kill ring, you have to *C-h v* and type =kill-ring=
to see content of the kill ring, and it is not pretty.

=helm-show-kill-ring= solves this problem: Helm shows the kill ring in
a readable format and allows you to narrow down by entering
sub-strings of candidates. You are freed from the cognitive burden of
the default *M-y*.

If you follow my Helm configuration, =M-y= binds to
=helm-show-kill-ring=. Try it and see! Much easier than the default.

_Demo_:

=helm-kill-ring= in action (the demo starts when you see ~START~ in the
minibuffer):

[[file:static/part3/helm-kill-ring.gif][file:static/part3/helm-kill-ring.gif]]

* Command: =helm-mini=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0386c827-7f5d-4056-bf4d-8d0fc01fc1ab
:END:
_Key binding_:

No default key binding. We should give it one:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x b") 'helm-mini)
#+end_src

To enable fuzzy matching, add the following settings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq helm-buffers-fuzzy-matching t
        helm-recentf-fuzzy-match    t)
#+end_src

=helm-mini= is comprised of multiple sources:

- Current open buffers, under the header =Buffers=.
- Recently opened files, under the header =Recentf=.
- Allows you to create a new buffer by pressing *RET*, under the header
  =Create Buffer=.

You can move back and forth between the groups by using *<left>* and
*<right>* arrow keys. Or you can just scroll down/up with *C-v* and
*M-v*.

You can filter out buffers by major mode using the pattern
=*<major-mode>=. For example, =*dired= narrows to only Dired
buffers. You can also filter out buffers that belong to a major mode
by adding =!= to the pattern. For example, =*!dired= select all buffers
that are not in Dired mode.

You can also select buffers in a specific directory by using the pattern
=/directory=. For example, =/.emacs.d/= narrows to buffers that are
only inside =.emacs.d=. Add =!= before the pattern for reverse
version. For example, =!/.emacs.d/= narrows to buffers not in
=.emacs.d=.

You can even use =helm-mini= to narrow to buffers that contain a
regexp in their contents, by prepending =@= to the search
pattern. For example, you can select buffers that only contain the
string "test": =@test=. If you want to see the locations of the string
in the buffers, mark all the buffer with *M-a* and *C-s* while in
=helm-mini= session, to switch to =helm-moccur=. You can mark buffers
to search with *C-SPC*. When you switch to =helm-moccur=, matches that
are in selected buffers are displayed. You can also perform =occur=
only on the current buffer with prefix argument: *C-u C-s*; this is
useful when you already marked buffers but don't want to unmark just
to view only in a buffer. However, in general, you won't need *C-u
C-s*.

Meaning of colors and prefixes for buffers:

- Remote buffers are prefixed with '@'.
- Red => Buffer has had its file modified on disk by an external
  process.
- Indianred2 => Buffer exists but its file has been deleted.
- Orange => Buffer is modified and its file has not been saved to disk.
- Italic => A non-file buffer.

Some Emacs themes change the colors. You should check the
corresponding color in your color themes.

Example:

- If I enter the pattern: =*lisp ^helm @moc=, Helm will narrow
  down the list by selecting only buffers that are in lisp mode, start
  by helm and match "moc" in their contents.

- If I want to specify more than one major-mode, separate them with
  =,=, e.g =*!lisp,!sh,!fun= will list all buffers but the ones in
  lisp-mode, sh-mode and fundamental-mode.

- If I enter the pattern: =*lisp ^helm moc=. Notice there is no
  =@= this time helm will look for lisp mode buffers starting by
  "helm" and have "moc" in their name.

- If I enter the pattern: =*!lisp !helm= Helm will narrow down
  to buffers that are not in "lisp" mode and that do not match "helm".

- If I enter the pattern: =/helm/ w3= Helm will narrow down
  buffers that are in any "helm" sub-directory and matching w3.

 =helm-mini= is like an interactive version of =ibuffer=.

_Demo_:

[[file:static/part3/helm-mini.gif][file:static/part3/helm-mini.gif]]

The demo starts when you see ~Eval: START~ in the minibuffer. Note that
the demo use =helm-buffers-list=, which is almost the same as
=helm-mini=. The only difference is that =helm-buffers-list= uses
=ido-virtual-buffers= for listing recently used files, while
=helm-mini= uses =recentf=.

- All the C buffers are selected using the pattern =*C=. In the demo,
  I also select Tcl buffers with *Tcl and then switched back to C 
  buffers with =*C=.

- I only want to have buffers that contain only the string
  =crash=. To do that, I add a space, then add the pattern
  =@crash=. After the initial search pattern, I hand the currently
  highlighted buffer over to =helm-moccur= (=moccur= with Helm interface)
  using *C-s*. Candidates can be filtered gradually by adding more
  patterns, e.g., I added =memory= to filter down to buffers that
  contain the string "memory" among the buffers that contain
  =crash=. You can also mark multiple with *C-SPC* or mark all buffers
  with *M-a* to search all buffers listed in =helm-mini=.

- As you can see, as I filtered, the number of candidates
  decreased, as displayed in the modeline. At the end, there were 12
  buffers remained as the result of filtering, down from the total 253
  buffers.

The demo above is part of [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm#advanced-usage][Helm's homepage]] now.

_Similar Commands_:

- =helm-multi-files=: this command lists buffers and recent files and
  files in current directory. However, when no match is found,
  =helm-mini= asks if you want to create a new buffer by highlighting
  the only entry, which look like this:

  [[file:static/helm-new-file-buffer.gif][file:static/helm-new-file-buffer.gif]]

  while =helm-multi-files= shows a blank buffer. However, you can
  start a =helm-locate= session to search the whole file system for
  the desired file by pressing *C-c p*. By default, =helm-for-files=
  is bound to =<prefix> f= (current prefix is *C-c h*).

- =helm-buffer-list=: similar to =helm-mini=, but instead of listing
  recent files from =recentf=, it uses =ido-virtual-buffers=, which is
  a list of recently visited files managed by =ido=. The virtual
  buffers do not contain paths. Depending on your preference, you can
  use this command in place of =helm-mini=. To enable fuzzy matching
  =ido-virtual-buffers=, if you set =helm-buffers-fuzzy-matching= to
  =t= already, you also get fuzzy matching for =ido-virtual-buffers=.

* Command: =helm-find-files=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b71abd6c-cb29-4b64-a55f-29bd75937c11
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> C-x C-f* or *C-x C-f* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or
*C-c h* if set). This is a rather long key sequence, and
*=helm-find-files= deserves a better binding:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-f") 'helm-find-files)
#+end_src

_Description_:

=helm-find-files= is file navigation on steroids:

- =helm-find-files= can fuzzy match candidates in the current
  directory. e.g "fob" or "fbr" will complete "foobar".

- You can also execute a persistent action, which is bound to *C-z* (by
  default) or *TAB* if you use my configuration, to narrow the current
  highlighting candidate; *C-z* or *TAB* again to view the contents of the
  buffer. You can scroll the other buffer up/down with *M-<next>* and
  *M-<prior>*.

- Alternatively, you can hit *C-j* to narrow to the highlighting candidate
  and *C-j* again to view the content of the other buffer. *C-l* goes
  back.

- You can also go up one directory level with *C-l*. *_NOTE_*: if you
  use *C-l*, Helm goes up one level and places the cursor on the directory
  you've just exited. If you want to go up and have the cursor on
  the parent directory, in Helm prompt, enter =../=. 

- After you go up with *C-l*, you can go back to the exact visited
  directories with *C-r*.

- To create a directory, enter a new name that does not exist in the
  current directory and append =/= at the end. After you create a
  directory, Helm continues in that directory.

- To create a new file, enter a name and select the top row that has
  the symbol =[?]= next to it. By default, Helm always selects the
  first match in the directory.

- You can invoke =grep= on the currently highlighted entry with
  *C-s*. *C-u C-s* performs a recursive grep.

- Enter =~/= at the end of the pattern to quickly reach home directory.

- Enter =/= at the end of the pattern to quickly reach root of your file system.

- Enter =./= at the end of the pattern to quickly reach `default-directory'
  (initial start of session). If you are in `default-directory' move
  cursor on top.

You can perform more actions on the highlighted entry by running
=helm-select-action=, which is bound to *TAB* by default and *C-z* in
my configuration. The guide for each action in the action menu is
written in the guide [[http://tuhdo.github.io/helm-projectile.html][Exploring large projects with Projectile and Helm
Projectile]]. It is written there because you will end up using
[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] (a project manage for Emacs, introduced in later section)
to navigate to files much more efficiently, anywhere and anytime you
need.

_Demo_: 

I only needed to type into the prompt a few character to get the
candidate I wanted among many candidates. The demo starts when you see
~START~ in the minibuffer:

[[file:static/part3/helm-find-files.gif][file:static/part3/helm-find-files.gif]]

**** _Find file at point_:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a70d8543-d81d-42f6-bd80-f0d459ed1a8c
:END:

Did you know the command =ffap=? It was introduced in part 1, but here
is the demo:

[[file:static/ffap.gif][file:static/ffap.gif]]

=helm-find-files= can do that too: all you need to do is move your
point onto a proper filepath, and Helm will reach the correct path for
you, similar to the screenshot. Now, you no longer have to use a
separate command to open the file at point, but using the same *C-x
C-f*. It's really convenient.

**** _File and directory histories_:
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e1b80059-4a23-4a65-adb7-916764b47695
:END:

With a prefix argument, =helm-find-files= displays a
list of visited directories. If one is selected at point,
=helm-find-files= starts in that directory and you can navigate
from there.

During a =helm-find-files= session, you can get a list of visited
files and directories with *C-c h*. From there, the default action is
*RET* to open the file/directory at point, or continue with
=helm-find-files= starting at that file/directory.

You can use *M-p* and *M-n* to move back and forth between previously
visited directory.

* Command: =helm-ff-do-grep=, live grep in Helm
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ded88dfc-ea36-4650-856b-b7e176836f46
:END:

_Key binding_: 

From within a =helm-find-files= session, you can invoke
=helm-ff-run-grep= with *C-s* to search a file/directory on
highlighted entry in the Helm buffer. With prefix argument *C-u*,
recursively greps a selected directory.

You can also save the result into a Grep buffer using the action
=Save results in Grep buffer=. Note that this Grep buffer is created
by Helm, not the default Emacs grep buffer. It has minimal key
bindings. In ~*hgrep*~ buffer, press *C-h m* to view all key
bindings.

_Description_:

Every time you type a character, =helm= updates =grep= result
immediately. You can use =ack-grep= to replace =grep= with this
configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (when (executable-find "ack-grep")
    (setq helm-grep-default-command "ack-grep -Hn --no-group --no-color %e %p %f"
          helm-grep-default-recurse-command "ack-grep -H --no-group --no-color %e %p %f"))
#+end_src

* Command: =helm-semantic-or-imenu=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       57d8eda0-9f2d-4aaf-b85d-3bcd261c40e8
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> i* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

The Imenu facility offers a way to find the major definitions,
such as function definitions or variable definitions in a file by
name. You can run =imenu= command individually.

Semantic is a package that provides language-aware editing
commands based on 'source-code parsers'.  When enabled, each file
you visit is automatically parsed. Semantic provides execellent
support for C/C++. To enable Semantic mode, execute
=(semantic-mode 1)=.

Helm offers an interface to both Semantic and Imenu at the same
time: If `semantic-mode' is active in the current buffer, then use
semantic for generating tags, otherwise fall back to =imenu=. If
point is on a symbol, helm feeds the symbol into input prompt by
default.

=helm-semantic-or-imenu= works with many modes like C/C++, Java,
Python, Ruby, Emacs Lisp and Lisp in general, shell script,
Org-mode...

To enable fuzzy matching for both =Semantic= and =Imenu= listing, add
the following setting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq helm-semantic-fuzzy-match t
        helm-imenu-fuzzy-match    t)
#+end_src

_Usage_:

- Invoke the command (by default, *C-c h i*).

- You can use the arrow keys or *C-p/C-n* to move up and down between
  candidates. You can also use *C-<down>* and *C-<up>*; as you move the
  selection between tags inside the Helm Semantic buffer, the point moves
  between tag locations as well.

- A nice feature of =helm-semantic-or-imenu= is that whenever you
  activate the command, if point is inside a Semantic tag
  (such as a function definition), the selection is positioned at the
  tag in the Helm buffer. This works nicely in combination with
  *C-<down>* and *C-<up>* to move between definitions in your buffer.

Helm gives you finer control: you can move between functions using
=beginning-of-defun= (bound to *C-M-a*) and =end-of-defun= (bound to
*C-M-e*), but it will also move the point and scroll your buffer. Using
=helm-semantic-or-imenu=, you have similar behavior and you have more
choices: either =C-g= to return back to the position where you originally
invoked =helm-semantic-or-imenu= because you only needed to look up a
function interface (e.g., to see what kinds of parameters a function
accepts), or =RET= to jump to the tag location. Currently, only the
Semantic part of =helm-semantic-or-imenu= is supported. If a buffer only
has =imenu= support from the command, you won't be able to use this
feature.

=helm-semantic-or-imenu= provides these types of Semantic tags: 

- =Dependencies=: the dependencies of the current file as defined by
  the current major mode. For example, =Dependencies= in C/C++ include
  header files. When you execute a persistent action on a dependency,
  the point moves to the location of that dependency in the current
  window.

- =Variables=: variables defined in current buffer.
- =Functions=: function defined in current buffer
- =Provides=: modules that this buffer provides; for example, =(provide
  ...)= expression in Emacs Lisp.

If you want to filter by tag type, enter caret character =^=
(beginning of line in regex) and follow the first character of that
type. For example, to see only function tags, type =^f= in
the prompt.

_Demo 1_:

DEMO (begin when =START DEMO= is in minibuffer):

- First, I use =helm-semantic-or-imenu= to move to the function
  helm-define-key-with-subkeys and move point there.

- Then, I start =helm-semantic-or-imenu= again and
  helm-define-key-with-subkeys is pre-selected.

- Then, I move point to the variable =helm-map= and execute
  =helm-semantic-or-imenu= again on two function: =helm-next-source=
  and =helm-previous-source=. This time, instead of showing the
  current semantic tag I'm operating in (which is =helm-map=), it
  shows the other two tags in Helm Semantic buffer. This is because I
  supplied a prefix argument before running the command.

  [[file:static/part3/helm-semantic-or-imenu-2.gif][file:static/part3/helm-semantic-or-imenu-2.gif]]

_Demo 2_:

Here is =helm-semantic-or-imenu= in action, please notice the
"pattern: " prompt in the minibuffer:

- At first, I narrow to candidates that are functions with this
  pattern in the prompt: =Functi=.

- Then, I narrow to candidates that are functions and contain
  =void= in them with this pattern: =functi void=, effectively
  selecting functions that have type =void= *or* accept =void= arguments.

- Then, I narrow to candidates that are functions and contain =int=
  in them with this pattern: =functi int=, effectively selecting functions
  that have type =int= *or* accept =int= arguments.

- Then, I narrow to candidates that are variables and contain =u16=
  in them, effectively selecting only variables that have type =u16=; the
  same for =u32= in the demo.

  [[file:static/part3/helm-semantic-or-imenu.gif][file:static/part3/helm-semantic-or-imenu.gif]]

Press *RET* to visit the the candidate location. The above examples are just
demonstrations. You can narrow to anything you want with search
patterns separated by spaces, e.g., you can use two patterns,
"func" and a part of a function name, and Helm can narrow to it
fine.

In the demo, you see things like =class u16= and =class u32=; that is
because =u16= and =u32= are defined by typedef.

* Command: =helm-man-woman=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2578b1bd-7ae9-4250-b701-c9191603404f
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> m* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

With =helm-man-woman=, you can quickly jump to any man entry using the
Helm interface, either by typing in Helm prompt or if the point is on a
symbol, opening the man page at point. To enable man page at point, add the
following code:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'helm-sources-using-default-as-input 'helm-source-man-pages)
#+end_src

Demo:

[[file:static/part3/helm-man-woman.gif]]

* Command: =helm-find=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b7a95407-8629-48c4-bc9c-d0a391c95478
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> /* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

Normally, you use =find= command with arguments in terminal, then
press *RET* and wait for a big list of result, and if the result is not
as expected, repeat the whole thing. You can shorten this process by
interactively get results from Unix =find= for every character you
enter into Helm prompt.

You can separate search patterns by spaces. However, since Helm is
using Unix =find= utility, you have to enter search patterns according
to the search string of =find=; use =helm-man-woman= to read the =find=
man page.

By default, invoking =helm-find= only searches current directory. With
prefix argument =C-u= (i.e. =C-u C-c h /=), a prompt asks for a
directory to find. =helm-find= can be invoked within =helm-find-files=
session, by using *C-c /*. To open more than one file, mark individual
candidates with *C-SPC* or mark all with *M-a*, then *RET*. You can
switch to =helm-find-files= with *C-x C-f*.

If you use =helm-find= on a large directory and feel live updating is too
sluggish, you can always suspend the live updating with *C-!* and
resume the live updating with *C-!* later.

_Demo_:

[[file:static/part3/helm-find.gif][file:static/part3/helm-find.gif]]

* Command: =helm-locate=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0e8e485d-c539-4175-9c81-9c8f9f17f608
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> l* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

Similar to =helm-find=, but uses the =locate= command and accepts search
patterns according to =locate= input. Use =helm-man-woman= to read
=locate= man page. In Mac OS, =mdfind= is used instead. On Windows,
you need to install [[http://www.voidtools.com/][Everything search engine]]; once you installed
Everything and expose =es.exe= to Emacs via the PATH environment
variable, =helm-locate= will use =Everything= and work out of the box
without any configuration.

To use a local database, execute =helm-locate= with prefix argument
=C-u=.

If you use =helm-locate= on a large hard drive and feel live updating is
too sluggish, you can always suspend the live updating with *C-!* and
resume the live updating with *C-!* later.

To enable fuzzy matching in =helm-locate=, add this setting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq helm-locate-fuzzy-match t)
#+end_src

Note that it is currently working with =locate= command in Linux. If
you are on other platform, don't set it or you won't have any result.

* Command: =helm-occur=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5fe9a6c3-5af2-4b4a-94ff-5849560c831f
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> M-s o* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if
set). Since this is a rather long binding, we should bind a more
convenient key sequence:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c h o") 'helm-occur)
#+end_src

_Description_:

Similar to =occur=, but using Helm interface. As you type, matching
lines are updated immediately. This is convenient when you want to
have a list of matches in the current buffer to jump back and
forth. *TAB* to temporarily move the point to the location of the currently
highlighted match. *C-g* cancels the current Helm session and returns to
the original location where =helm-occur= was invoked. *RET* on a match
jumps to that match.

_Demo_:

You can see that candidates keep getting updated when I
type. The demo starts when you see =START= in the minibuffer.

* Command: =helm-apropos=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       479cdaab-0aba-48b8-b4d2-b026d23eb41a
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> a* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

Pre-configured helm to describe commands, functions, variables and
faces - all in one command!. It is similar to *C-h a* which runs
=apropos-command=, but interactive includes more than just commands.
=helm-apropos= combines 5 sources:

- *Commands*: Lists all available commands.
- *Fucntion*: Lists all available functions.
- *Classes*: Lists all classes created by =defclass=. See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eieio/Building-Classes.html][Building
  Classes]].
- *Generic Functions*: Lists all functions created by =defmethod=. See
  [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eieio/Writing-Methods.html#Writing-Methods][Writing Methods]] 
- *Variables*: Lists all available variables.
- *Faces*: Lists all available faces.
- *Helm attributes*: Lists all attributes that you can use to build a
  Helm source. Useful if you want to write extension with Helm.

To enable fuzzy matching, add this setting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq helm-apropos-fuzzy-match t)
#+end_src

* Command: =helm-info-*=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       93e5fcb9-231b-43b8-81df-501a59bca2b6
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> h <key>* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if
set); *<key>*, by default, is one of *g*, *i* or *r*:

| Key            | Binding                       |
|----------------+-------------------------------|
| *<prefix> h g* | Command: =helm-info-gnus=     |
| *<prefix> h i* | Command: =helm-info-at-point= |
| *<prefix> h r* | Command: =helm-info-emacs=    |
|----------------+-------------------------------|

_Description_:

The prefix for info commands is =<prefix> h=. You can think of =h=
as stands for *help* and *<key>* is one of the info topic to make it
easier to remember.

=helm= offers a wide ranges of info commands for various topics. =M-x
helm info= to see these commands, i.e. =helm-info-as=,
=helm-info-gdb=... You can search for info nodes easily with the Helm
interface and press *TAB* on an entry to view. *M-<next>* moves to the next
page, and *M-<prior>* moves to the previous page in the other buffer.

You can have more =helm-info-= commands, such as:

- =helm-info-gdb=.
- =helm-info-find=.
- =helm-info-elisp=.
....

Use =M-x helm-info= to see the list of =helm-info-= commands using the
default info prefix: =<prefix> h= or key bindings of your choice.

* Command: =helm-lisp-completion-at-point=
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> <tab>* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

If you work with Emacs Lisp, this command provides a list of available
loaded functions in Emacs. To get a list of completions, you first
have to write a prefix, even just one character. Then execute the
command and get a list of completion candidates. To enable fuzzy
matching, add this setting:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq helm-lisp-fuzzy-completion t)
#+end_src

* Command: =helm-resume=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9d698347-33ee-447d-9fd1-eb01e9770dbb
:END:
_Key binding_:

 *<prefix> b* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

This command allows you to resume the previous Helm session, along
with your previous patterns in the prompt. For example, if your
last helm session was =helm-ff-run-grep= and you entered patterns in
Helm prompt, =helm-resume= resumes that session along with your
previous input.

With prefix argument, =helm-resume= allows you to choose among all
existing Helm buffers. =helm-mini= or =helm-buffer-list= does not
show existing Helm buffers; they ignore it by default; but if you
run =ibuffer=, you will see a list of Helm buffers visible
there. Don't kill them or you won't be able to resume.

This is really convenient when you have complex input ,and
preparation steps. For example, if you have multiple regexp
patterns in your previous Helm session, then you don't have to
type it again. Or in your previous Helm session, you have to
travel to a deep directory, and =helm-resume= helps you to reuse
your previous session without going through all the troubles
again.

* Command: =helm-all-mark-rings=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       12d8e9d0-1a43-434f-8398-6bb5deb729df
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> C-c SPC* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if
set). This is a rather long key sequence, this command deserves a
better binding, for example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-h SPC") 'helm-all-mark-rings)
#+end_src

_Description_:

One handy command. It allows you to view the content of the both the
local and global mark rings in a friendly interface, so you can always
jump back to where you were. Without this command, if you want to view
the mark rings, you have to run *M-:* and enter =mark-ring= or
=global-mark-ring= to view  their contents. And even so, Emacs only
displays the bare content of the =mark-ring= and =global-mark-ring=
lists, which is the line number and its buffer like this:

=(#<marker at 23614 in helm.org> #<marker at 2343 in setup-helm.el> #<marker at 4280 in helm.org> #<marker in no buffer> #<marker at 1271 in helm.org> #<marker at 643 in emacs-tutor.org> #<marker in no buffer> #<marker at 1 in setup-applications.el> #<marker at 1 in emacs-tutor3.org>)=

With =helm-all-mark-rings=, you have this nice interface with line
content and syntax highlighting:

_Description_:

Pre-configured helm to build regexps. This commands is useful when you
want to test out a regexp interactively. The following actions are
available with *C-z*:

:END:
_Key binding_: 

*<prefix> C-c g* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if
set). Let's bind it to something else:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c h g") 'helm-google-suggest)
#+end_src

_Description_:

This command allows you to interactively enter search terms and get
results from Google in a Helm buffer. Then, you can open one of the
candidates in other services, such as Google, Wikipedia, Youtube,
Imbd, Google Maps, Google News. If you are on Windows, don't type too
fast or, you will have an error and you have to abandon this Helm
session.

:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> c* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

If you want to quickly view and copy hexadecimal values of colors,
=helm-color= provides such a feature. But, =helm-color= is beyond a
mere color picker. The real usage for =helm-color= is for face
customization: the command list ALL available faces, with a preview of
each face in the same row. This makes theme customization really quick
because you can quickly view a face with its color. Because of the way
Helm works, you can look at a group of faces together to have a global
view of whether or not the colors work well with each other.

=helm-color= contains two groups, with actions in each:

- Colors:

| Key               | Action                                |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------|
| *[f1]* or *C-c N* | =Copy Name=                           |
|                   | Copy color name into kill-ring        |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------|
| *[f2]* or *C-c R* | =Copy RGB=                            |
|                   | Copy hex value into kill-ring         |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------|
| *[f3]* or *C-c n* | =Insert Name=                         |
|                   | Insert color name into current buffer |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------|
| *[f4]* or *C-c r* | =Insert RGB=                          |
|                   | Insert hex value  into current buffer |
|-------------------+---------------------------------------|

- Customize Face: 

| Key    | Action                    |
|--------+---------------------------|
| *[f1]* | =Customize=               |
|        | Open Customization window |
|--------+---------------------------|
| *[f2]* | =Copy Name=               |
|        | Copy face name            |

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5ff6249d-02a6-449a-98b8-9b40664b32ce
:END:
_Key binding_:

*<prefix> C-:* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if
set). *C-:* is a bit difficult to press, it would be better with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c h M-:") 'helm-eval-expression-with-eldoc)
#+end_src

_Description_:

This command allows you to enter Emacs Lisp expressions and get
instant results in a Helm buffer for every character you type. The
changed key binding above makes it easier to remember, since the
stock =eval-expression= binds to *M-:*. So, from now on, to eval
expression without live update, use *M-:*, and with live update, use
*C-c h M-:*. This command is useful when you want to try out a command
with various inputs, and want to see the results as fast as
possible.

_Key binding_:

*<prefix> C-,* (prefix is *C-x c* by default, or *C-c h* if set).

_Description_:

This commands provides a Helm interface for the =calc= command. What is
=calc=? According to [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html#Getting-Started][Calc Manual]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Calc is an advanced calculator and mathematical tool that runs as part
of the GNU Emacs environment. Very roughly based on the HP-28/48
series of calculators, its many features include:

- Choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry of calculations.
- Arbitrary precision integers and floating-point numbers.
- Arithmetic on rational numbers, complex numbers (rectangular and
  polar), error forms with standard deviations, open and closed
  intervals, vectors and matrices, dates and times, infinities, sets,
  quantities with units, and algebraic formulas.
- Mathematical operations such as logarithms and trigonometric functions.
- Programmer's features (bitwise operations, non-decimal numbers).
- Financial functions such as future value and internal rate of return.
- Number theoretical features such as prime factorization and arithmetic modulo m for any m.
- Algebraic manipulation features, including symbolic calculus.
- Moving data to and from regular editing buffers.
- Embedded mode for manipulating Calc formulas and data directly inside any editing buffer.
- Graphics using GNUPLOT, a versatile (and free) plotting program.
- Easy programming using keyboard macros, algebraic formulas, algebraic rewrite rules, or extended Emacs Lisp. 
#+END_QUOTE

You can enter valid =calc= mathematic expressions such as +, -,*, /,
sin, cos, tan, sqrt.... To make the most out of this command, obviously
you should carefully study =calc= itself by reading the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/calc.html][Calc Manual]].

* Command: =helm-eshell-history=
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ad0fbac6-b78e-42b7-82d4-f95057401ba2
:END:

_Key binding_:

No key binding. Let's bind it to a key to be used in Eshell:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'helm-eshell)

  (add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook
            #'(lambda ()
                (define-key eshell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-l")  'helm-eshell-history)))
#+end_src

_Description_:

If you usually re-execute an old shell command in Eshell with *M-r*,
then =helm-eshell-history= provides an easy and efficient way to work
with command history. Using stock *M-r*, you have to actively remember
past commands you worked with; otherwise Eshell cannot find the
command. If you forget, you will have to type in the command =history=
to refresh your memory. =helm-eshell-history= combines the two: you
can interactively use a regexp to select past commands and get live
feedback with a list of commands that satisfy the search. Now you don't have to
remember which commands exist. Let Helm handle that problem for you.

_Demo_:

:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2c28164f-ddff-4733-8dc1-cddb0b121b4a
:END:
 Similar to =helm-eshell-history=, but used for =M-x shell=.

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (define-key shell-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-l") 'helm-comint-input-ring)

:END:
Do you ever feel uneasy operating on the minibuffer history when
it's getting large (say, hundreds of history items)? If so, Helm can
help you easily manage a large number of items in the history list
with ease using the Helm interface.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
